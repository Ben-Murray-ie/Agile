# Agile_Software_Development
 **Agile Software Development** 

In this project, we were given a program (InsuranceProgram.java) and our assignment was to refactor the code to support a wide variety of common J-Unit test types (eg. BeforeEach/All, AfterEach/All, Timeout, Test, ParameterizedTest, CsvSource, ValueSource etc.).

---

**Instructions:**

* To observe this program locally, import the project directory into an IDE with J-Unit support (Eclipse was used to create the program).
* SuiteTest.java can be run to perform all tests included and show final code coverage.
